# Task 1 - Open Science MOOC (Module 5)
This repository was created to complete the first task of module 5 of the Open Science MOOC.
Since it's just a test repository. It doesn't include any valuable piece of code. However, I encourage everyone to have a look at the Open Science MOOC to gather more information about how to conduct research following open science practices.
